## Problem Statement
This should simulate tic tac toe game on which participating players can bet using
ether/erc20 token.
### Specs
1. Player 1 creates a new game specifying & depositing bet in ether or erc20 token
2. Player 2 accepts the challenge & deposits matching amount
3. The game begins once Player 2 makes first move
4. Once winner is decided, move locked funds to winner's address. Normal tic tac toe
rules apply.
### Expectations
1. Clean & modular solidity code
2. Readme
3. Note assumptions
4. Approach on how winner is decided
### Bonus Points
1. User interactions with contracts via meta-transactions (check 0x project)
2. Simple react UI. Assume things as needed. Use tools as required.
### Duration
Maximum 4 days (the sooner the better)
